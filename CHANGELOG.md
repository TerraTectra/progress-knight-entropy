# Changelog

<<<<<<< HEAD
## 1.0.1 - Entropy UX polish
- Entropy tab now follows a single unlock gate and remains visible after binding the Almanac.
- Entropy unlock visibility and shop items stay rendered after discovery; affordability only disables actions.
- Added helper-based requirement checks and improved long-label wrapping/readability on dark panels.

## 1.0.0 - Initial stable build
- Core systems: Entropy, Seeds, Patterns, Evil & Dark Magic, synergies.
- Meta: Achievements, Challenges, capstone overlay.
- UX: Dark-first theme, guide overlay, plateau hint, shop and Dark Magic hints, low-FX option.
- Stability: Hardened save/import (versioned, safe merge, import fallback), DOM diffing, tick micro-profiler.
- Options: Language selection, hints toggle, low-FX mode.
=======
## Stage 3 - 2025-12-11
- Unified requirement helper usage across unlock/visibility checks for tasks, jobs, shop items, automation, and entropy tab handling.
- Standardized requirement messaging through shared display helpers with i18n coverage (universe, age, meaning, entropy seeds, evil, coins) and hooked shop locks into the same pipeline.
- Added wrapping support for requirement cells to keep long localized labels readable in required rows and shop states.
